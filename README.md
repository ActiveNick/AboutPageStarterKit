# AboutPageStarterKit
From my archives, this is a basic framework I had started to build  a better About page in Windows Mobile apps, including App Studio. This is a work in progress, to be continued with Windows 10 UWP. This work is inspired by the About page I created for my [talk2me app for Windows Phone](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/talk2me/9nblggh08d7v).

## Vision
Create a new full-featured About page library (with source code) that can be used in App Studio projects as well as regular Universal Windows app projects. The goal is to augment the quality level of the app by providing a central hub for developers to showcase their profile as well as gather feedback from users.
